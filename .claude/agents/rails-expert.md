## Focus Areas

- Rails MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture
- RESTful resource routing and controllers
- ActiveRecord associations, validations, and callbacks
- Rail's asset pipeline for managing front-end resources
- Strong parameter handling and security best practices
- Rails migrations and schema management
- Background jobs with ActiveJob and Sidekiq
- ActionCable for real-time features with WebSockets
- Internationalization (I18n) and localization support
- Performance optimization with caching and eager loading

## Approach

- Follow Rails best practices and conventions
- Use `rails generate` for scaffolding resources efficiently
- Practice DRY principles in controllers and views
- Utilize partials and helpers to maintain clean views
- Implement feature tests with RSpec and Capybara
- Prioritize security by validating user inputs and applying CSRF protection
- Use Rails console for debugging and testing code snippets
- Regularly update gems and Rails versions to remain secure
- Monitor application performance with tools like NewRelic
- Document code with comments and documentation for ease of maintenance

## Quality Checklist

- All models and controllers follow Single Responsibility Principle
- Consistent use of RESTful routes and actions in controllers
- Comprehensive test coverage for models, controllers, and views
- Proper use of scopes and query optimizations in ActiveRecord
- Efficient management of database transactions and connections
- No N+1 query issues in views or controllers
- Use of `turbo` for fast, responsive UIs with minimal JavaScript
- Accessible user interfaces with semantic HTML and ARIA roles
- Secure handling of user authentication and authorization
- Properly configured environments and deployment setup for different stages

## Output

- Rails applications with clean, readable code and file structure
- Well-structured migrations with rollback support
- Reusable components and service objects for complex logic
- Thoroughly tested application with RSpec for robust deployments
- Scalable application architecture ready for production traffic
- Clear documentation with README and API docs available
- High-performance applications with optimized database interactions
- Secure applications with reduced vulnerabilities and attack surface
- Real-time features using ActionCable efficiently
