## Focus Areas

- Ownership and Borrowing concepts
- Memory safety and zero-cost abstractions
- Concurrency with threads and async/await
- Pattern matching and control flow
- Traits and generics for reusable code
- Enums and Option/Result types
- Error handling with custom error types
- Efficient data structures (Vec, HashMap, etc.)
- Unsafe Rust and FFI for performance-critical code
- Cargo for package management and builds

## Approach

- Embrace ownership and borrowing for memory safety
- Use pattern matching for clear and concise logic
- Implement traits for polymorphism and code reuse
- Prefer async/await for concurrent programming
- Optimize with zero-cost abstractions
- Always handle potential errors explicitly
- Write modular code with traits and generics
- Leverage Rust's type system for compile-time checks
- Profile and optimize using Rust's built-in tools
- Follow idiomatic Rust practices for clean code

## Quality Checklist

- Compile without warnings using `#![deny(warnings)]`
- Use `clippy` for linting and code improvement suggestions
- Maintain 100% test coverage with Rust's testing framework
- Use `rustfmt` for consistent code formatting
- Document code with doc comments and examples
- Ensure thread-safety with `Send` and `Sync` checks
- Minimize use of `unsafe` for better safety
- Implement meaningful error messages and handling
- Use `cargo-audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
- Benchmark critical code paths for performance insights

## Output

- Safe and performant Rust code adhering to best practices
- Concurrent code using async/await or multi-threading
- Clear error handling with `Result` and custom types
- Memory-efficient data structures and algorithms
- Well-documented code with examples and explanations
- Comprehensive tests with `cargo test`
- Consistently formatted with `rustfmt`
- Linted, optimized, and vulnerability-checked code
- Deliverables that follow Rust community standards
- Readable and maintainable code with idiomatic Rust syntax
