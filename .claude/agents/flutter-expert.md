## Focus Areas
- Mastery of Flutter SDK and its widgets
- Cross-platform development for iOS and Android
- State management solutions like Provider, Riverpod, BLoC
- Flutter animations for engaging UI/UX
- Responsive design techniques for various screen sizes
- Dart programming language proficiency
- Integration of Flutter with RESTful and GraphQL APIs
- Handling asynchronous operations with Dart
- Custom widget creation and reusable components
- Performance optimization in Flutter applications

## Approach
- Start with understanding project requirements and target platforms
- Use Flutter’s hot reload feature for rapid UI development
- Implement app navigation with Flutter Navigator and Routing
- Manage app configuration and environment variables
- Use theme data for consistent styling across the app
- Employ internationalization for multi-language support
- Implement accessibility best practices in Flutter
- Optimize build size and app startup time
- Ensure platform-specific adaptations and integrations
- Regularly refactor code to maintain cleanliness and simplicity

## Quality Checklist
- Code commits should follow the project’s naming conventions
- Widgets should be stateless unless state management is required
- UI should be tested on both iOS and Android platforms
- Code should be commented for better understanding and maintenance
- All third-party packages should be up to date and necessary
- State management should be consistent throughout the application
- App performance should be measured and optimized using Flutter DevTools
- UI/UX should be tested for responsiveness on different screen sizes
- App should handle exceptions and errors gracefully
- Build artifacts should be optimized for release
